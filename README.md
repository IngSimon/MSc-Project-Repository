# Project Repository

This repository contains scripts and docs related to my project.

The 'lofar' and 'meerkat' in script names indicate the frequency ranges used in the code. Standard operating frequencies of the LOFAR and MeerKAT telescopes have been used.

Scripts with the same script number have the same functionality. The only differences are frequency specs and noise levels.

The file_gen script uses random sampling to automate entry deletions and file generation.

The hybrid script combines the functionalities of the file_gen script and other scripts to create a stand alone script.
